DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------
ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00094.001
Name: Soil water content and water salinity
Description: Soil volumetric water content and an index of salinity at various depth below the soil surface from 2 cm up to 200 cm at non-permafrost sites (up to 300 cm at Alaskan sites). Data are from all five Instrumented Soil Plots per site and presented as 1-minute and 30-minute averages.
NEON Science Team Supplier: TIS
"Abstract: Soil volumetric water content and an index of soil water ion content (salinity) are measured at various depths below the soil surface from approximately 2 cm up to 200 cm at non-permafrost sites (up to 300 cm at Alaskan sites). Soil moisture is an important component of the hydrologic cycle and is the dominant source of water for most plants and soil organisms making it a key indicator of drought. In addition, soil moisture status influences the severity of flooding and temperature extremes, as well as physical, chemical and biological processes in the soil. Measurements are made in vertical profiles consisting of up to eight depths in all five instrumented soil plots at each terrestrial site, and presented as 1-minute and 30-minute averages."

Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.
"Brief Design Description: When possible the soil plots were arranged in a transect with the first plot approximately 15-40 m from the tower in the expected dominant airshed. The middle of airshed was used as the transect vector and plot spacing was based on the distance required for surface soil temperature and moisture measurements to be spatially independent at the 1 hectare scale during site characterization (capped at approximately 40 m due to logistical constraints). Soil plots were microsited as necessary to avoid obstacles (e.g., boulders, streams, and paths) and more compact plot layouts were used at small sites. Soil moisture and salinity index are measured at up to eight depths within each plot, with the mid-point of the shallowest sensors at"
Brief Study Area Description: Soil water content and an index of salinity are measured in all five instrumented soil plots at each terrestrial site.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------
NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API.
NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv
"The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information."
"General conventions, used for all data products:"
"NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI."
"DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)."
"SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code."
"DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;"
"PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog)."
"REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new."
"HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005."
"VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505."
"TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year."
DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table.
YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file.
"PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below)."
"GENTIME: the date-time stamp when the file was generated, in UTC. The format of the date-time stamp is YYYYMMDDTHHmmSSZ."
Time stamp conventions:
YYYY: Year
"YY: Year, last two digits only"

CHANGE LOG
----------
Issue Date: 2021-01-14
"Issue: The annual refresh of sensors and data acquisition systems (DAS) also did not occur according to the typical 1-year schedule for many sites. The annual refresh is where freshly calibrated and verified sensors and DAS replace the units that have been deployed for a year. While NEON is working towards implementing automated drift estimations/corrections on calibrated data products and flagging related to sensors that fall outside the policy for calibration frequency, this had not been implemented at the time of COVID impacts."
The following sites had annual refreshes canceled in 2020 and will likely go up to two years of deployment for their sensors:

BART (due Aug 2020)

Resolution:
Issue Date: 2020-03-26
"Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment will be entered at that time."

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------
"The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed."

"Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5"

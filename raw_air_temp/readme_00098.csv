FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------
NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API.
NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv
"The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information."
"General conventions, used for all data products:"
"NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI."
"DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)."
"SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code."
"DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;"
"PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog)."
"REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new."
"HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005."
"VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505."
"TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 ="
NA
DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table.
YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file.
"PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below)."
"GENTIME: the date-time stamp when the file was generated, in UTC. The format of the date-time stamp is YYYYMMDDTHHmmSSZ."
Time stamp conventions:
YYYY: Year
"YY: Year, last two digits only"
MM: Month: 01-12
DD: Day: 01-31
T: Indicator that the time stamp is beginning
HH: Hours: 00-23
mm: Minutes: 00-59
SS: Seconds: 00-59
"Z: Universal Time Coordinated (Universal Coordinated Time), or UTC"

CHANGE LOG
----------
Issue Date: 2021-01-14
"Issue: Safety measures to protect personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced or eliminated maintenance activities for extended periods at NEON sites. Data availability and/or quality may be negatively impacted during this time, and extra scrutiny of data is advised."
"The annual refresh of sensors and data acquisition systems (DAS) also did not occur according to the typical 1-year schedule for many sites. The annual refresh is where freshly calibrated and verified sensors and DAS replace the units that have been deployed for a year. While NEON is working towards implementing automated drift estimations/corrections on calibrated data products and flagging related to sensors that fall outside the policy for calibration frequency, this had not been implemented at the time of COVID impacts."
The following sites had annual refreshes canceled in 2020 and will likely go up to two years of deployment for their sensors:
BLWA (due May 2020)
TOMB (due May 2020)
BARR (due June 2020)
BLUE (due Sept 2020)
BART (due Aug 2020)
NOGP (due Aug 2020)

Issue Date: 2020-03-26
"Issue: Regularization rate (raw data binning) was changed from 1 Hz to 0.5 Hz in processing to more closely match the field collection rate. The averaging intervals (1-min and 30-min) for the Level 1 data product remain unchanged. The date of resolution indicates the date this change was made in forward processing. Previously processed data will be reprocessed with the new regularization rate prior to the first NEON data release, and another changelog comment will be created at that time."

Resolution Date: 2020-06-10

2020-06-10: All data reprocessed with updated algorithm.
Issue Date: 2020-03-26
"Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment"

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------
"The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed."

"Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing"
